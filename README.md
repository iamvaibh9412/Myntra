📈 Evaluation & Insights for business-driven decisions

Data such as product name, brand, rating, price, discount, etc., were scraped directly from the Myntra website.

Data Analysis
pandas for data wrangling

numpy for numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualization

Visualizations
Bar charts, box plots, and histograms to analyze:

Rating distribution

Brand-wise pricing

Discount analysis

Top-rated and top-discounted products

Machine Learning
To predict Product Ratings, the following models were trained and evaluated:
